        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2 cups of sushi rice</li>
            <li>2 cups of water</li>
            <li>1/4 cup of rice vinegar</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons of sugar</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon of salt</li>
            <li>4 sheets of nori seaweed</li>
            <li>Assorted fillings (such as avocado, cucumber, carrot, crab meat, cooked shrimp, smoked salmon, etc.)</li>
            <li>Soy sauce, wasabi, and pickled ginger (optional)</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Rinse the sushi rice in a fine mesh strainer until the water runs clear.</li>
            <li>In a medium saucepan, combine the rice and water and bring to a boil over high heat.</li>
            <li>Reduce the heat to low, cover the saucepan, and simmer for 18-20 minutes, or until the rice is tender and the water has been absorbed.</li>
            <li>In a small saucepan, combine the rice vinegar, sugar, and salt. Heat over low heat, stirring occasionally, until the sugar and salt have dissolved.</li>
            <li>Transfer the cooked rice to a large mixing bowl and add the vinegar mixture. Use a wooden spoon or spatula to gently fold the rice until it is evenly coated with the vinegar mixture. Allow the rice to cool to room temperature.</li>
            <li>Lay a sheet of nori seaweed on a sushi mat or a clean kitchen towel with the shiny side facing down.</li>
            <li>Wet your hands with water and scoop about 1/2 cup of sushi rice onto the nori sheet. Use your fingers to spread the rice evenly over the nori, leaving a 1-inch border at the top.</li>
            <li>Arrange your desired fillings in a line across the center of the rice.</li>
            <li>Use the sushi mat or kitchen towel to tightly roll the sushi away from you, using the border of rice at the top to seal the roll.</li>
            <li>Repeat with the remaining nori sheets and fillings.</li>
            <li>Use a sharp knife to slice the sushi rolls into bite-sized pieces.</li>
            <li>Serve with soy sauce, wasabi, and pickled ginger, if desired.</li>
        </ol>
