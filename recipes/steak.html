        <p>A butter basted steak is a delicious and flavorful way to cook a steak.</p>
        <p>The steak is seared in a hot skillet and then basted with melted butter, garlic, and herbs to create a rich and savory crust.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2 steaks, about 1 inch thick (ribeye, NY strip, or your preferred cut)</li>
            <li>Salt and pepper</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons of vegetable oil</li>
            <li>4 tablespoons of unsalted butter</li>
            <li>2 garlic cloves, smashed</li>
            <li>2 sprigs of fresh thyme</li>
            <li>1 sprig of fresh rosemary</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Remove the steaks from the refrigerator and let them come to room temperature for 30 minutes.</li>
            <li>Season the steaks generously with salt and pepper on both sides.</li>
            <li>Heat the vegetable oil in a large skillet over high heat until it begins to smoke.</li>
            <li>Add the steaks to the skillet and sear for 2-3 minutes on each side until browned.</li>
            <li>Reduce the heat to medium and add the butter, garlic, thyme, and rosemary to the skillet.</li>
            <li>Use a spoon to baste the steaks with the melted butter, spooning the butter over the steaks repeatedly for 1-2 minutes.</li>
            <li>Use a meat thermometer to check the internal temperature of the steaks. For medium-rare, the temperature should be 130-135Â°F.</li>
            <li>Remove the steaks from the skillet and let them rest for 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Slice the steaks against the grain and serve.</li>
        </ol>
